## 🔬 Core Capabilities

### 1. Differential Geometry
*   Curves and surfaces in 3D.
*   Manifolds, curvature, tensors, differential forms.

### 2. Algebraic Topology
*   Fundamental groups, covering spaces.
*   Homology and Cohomology groups.
*   Euler characteristic, Betti numbers.

## 💻 Tools
*   **SymPy DiffGeom**: Differential geometry module.
*   **NetworkX**: Can be used for calculating Euler characteristic of simplicial complexes (represented as graphs).
