# Module 1: Random Graphs (随机图)

## 1. G(n,p) Model
Random Graph G(n,p) has n nodes, and each edge exists with prob p.

## 2. Phase Transition
At p = 1/n, a Giant Component emerges.
- p < 1/n: Small trees (log n)
- p > 1/n: Giant component (size ~ n)

## 3. Connectivity
Graph becomes connected at p = ln(n)/n.

## Playground Challenge
Set n=100. Critical p is 0.01. Connectivity at 0.046.
